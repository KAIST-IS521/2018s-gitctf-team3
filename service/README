--[ 1 - Introduction ]--------------------------------------------------

CHATSRV serves as an example of a chat server implemented in C. In order
to use the chat server, clients connect to it by using a simple telnet
client, such as linux or windows telnet or putty.

This tool was built as part of a seminar paper worked on at school.

--[ 2 - The Tool ]------------------------------------------------------

----[ 2.1 - Features ]--------------------------------------------------

The current version of CHATSRV offers the following features:

  + Multi-Threading:
    CHATSRV is implemented as a multi-threaded chat server. For each 
    incoming client connection, a new thread will be created, which
    handles incoming messages from clients. 
  
  + Command-Line Parameters
    Pass command-line parameters to the server to configure its 
    behaviour in more detail. Parsing of command-line parameters is done
    by using the GNU getopt library.
  
  + Advanced Logging
    CHATSRV uses a special logging mechanism, which allows to print log
    messages on the server console using different log levels. Supported
    log levels include ERROR, INFO and DEBUG. Each log message includes
    a detailled timestamp.
  
  + Fast Reuse of Sockets
    After shutting down CHATSRV, its TCP connection is held in a 
    TIME_WAIT state for a certain amount of time (depends on OS). This 
    can become unhandy if the server shall be restarted and the service 
    interruption shall be kept at a minimum. Therefore, CHATSRV 
    implements a special behaviour, which allows for faster reuse of a 
    previously used TCP port to bring the server back online very fast.
  
  + Graceful Server Shutdown Using Signals
    CHATSRV implements signal handling capabilities which allow a
    server administrator to perform a graceful shutdown. After receiving
    either the SIGINT or the SIGTERM signal, CHATSRV cleans up allocated
    memory, closes socket connections and terminates running threats. 
    Then it terminates itself and returns to the shell.

  + ANSI Color Support
    To better distinguish between each others messages. Uses various of
    colors to improve display of messages.

  + Joiner / Leaver Notification
    If a user joins or leaves the chat server, all other users will be
    notified.
    
  + Support for Nickname Change
    Users can change their nicknames during a chat session. All other
    users will be notified about this change.
    
  + Duplicate Nickname Detection
    Recognizes if other chat buddies already use the desired nickname.
    The user is notified about that and asked to choose another name.  
    
  + Private Messages
    Users can send private messages to each others. Private messages
    are only visible to the sender and the receiver.
  

----[ 2.2 - Usage ]-----------------------------------------------------

This chapter explains basic usage of CHATSRV.


----[ 2.2.1 - Command-line Arguments ]----------------------------------

The following command-line arguments are supported:

--ip=<ip address>, -i <ip address>
	
	Specifies the ip address which shall be used by CHATSRV. If no ip
	address is specified, 127.0.0.1 will be used by default.

--port=<port number>, -p <port number>

    Specifies the TCP port to be used by CHATSRV. If no port is
    specified, port 5555 will be used by default.

--loglevel=<level>, -l <level>         

    Specifies the desired log level. The following levels are supported:
        1 = ERROR (Log errors only)
        2 = INFO (Log additional information)
        3 = DEBUG (Log debug level information)
        
    If no log level is specified, INFO will be used by default.

--version, -v

    Displays version information.

--help, -h 

    Display help page.


----[ 2.2.2 - Starting the Chat Server ]--------------------------------

Usage of this tool is quite simple. Do start the chat server, simply 
issue the following command on the shell:

$ ./chatsrv

This starts CHATSRV using its default configuration. Use the following
command, if you would like to specify ip address and port:

$ ./chatsrv --ip=192.168.1.1 --port=8888

This starts CHATSRV on ip address 192.168.1.1, listening on port 8888.


----[ 2.2.3 - Connecting to the Chat Server ]---------------------------

In order to be able to chat with others, you must connect to CHATSRV
first. to do this, you'll only need a simple telnet client:

$ telnet 192.168.1.1 5555

This connects you to the chat server running on 192.168.1.1, port 5555.
You can now start entering your messages. Your messages will be
broadcasted to all other logged in users on this chat server.


----[ 2.2.4 - Disconnecting from the Chat Server ]----------------------

To disconnect from the chat server, use the /quit command. See 2.3 for
a detailed list of supported chat commands.


----[ 2.2.5 - Shutting Down the Chat Server ]---------------------------

The proper way to shutdown the chat server is either by entering
Ctrl + C on the console screen of the running CHATSRV program or by
sending a SIGINT or SIGTERM signal to the CHATSRV process by using the
kill command as an example:

$ ./kill -s SIGTERM 4344

This sends the SIGTERM to the process running using a PID of 4344. 


----[ 2.2.6 - Redirecting the Server Console Output to a File ]---------

If you like to keep your chat logs, just redirect the server console
output to a text file by starting CHATSRV using the following commands:

$ ./chatsrv -l 3 | tee chatsrv.log


----[ 2.3 - Supported Chat Commands ]-----------------------------------

The chat server recognizes the following commands from clients:

/nick <nickname>

    Allows the user to change his nickname to <nickname>. Plese note,
    that, for security reasons, only letters a-z, A-Z and numbers 0-9
    are allowed to build a nickname.

/msg <nickname> <message>

    Sends a private message <message> to user <nickname>.

/me <message>

    Use this to say something about yourself. /me will be replated
    with your own nickname.
    
/quit

    Disconnects the user from the chat server.


----[ 2.4 - Building from Source ]--------------------------------------

Before you can build the tool from source, your system must meet some
preconditions. Currently they are:

  + gcc must be installed.
  + make must be installed.

The source distribution can be built from source by conducting the
following steps on your box:

  1. Copy the file chatsrv-<version>.tar.gz to your linux box. Make
     sure, it is located in a dedicated directory, since extraction
	 will put the files directly in there.

  2. Extract the tarball using:

     $ tar xvf chatsrv-<version>.tar.gz

  3. Compile the source code using:

     $ make

	 Optionally, you can compile it in debug mode in order to add debug
	 information to the resulting binary. You'll need that only if you
	 like to debug using gdb. To create a debug binary invoke:

     $ make DEBUG=1

The resulting binary is now ready to use.

As for now, I've tested the CHATSRV binary on the following platforms 
and it seems to just runs fine:

  + Arch Linux
  + Debian 6 Squeeze
